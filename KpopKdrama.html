	<p class="kpopdrama">KPOP (short for Korean pop) is a genre of music that orginated in South Korea, just as the names says.
	What makes it different from pop is the Korean traditional roots it comes from mixed in with other genres commonly found in Western society.
	KPOP plays a big role on the South Korean culture. 
	When marketing for the boy and girl groups, agencies come up with concepts to catch the fans' attention.
	This is where the unique choice of outfits play a big role.
	One moment the groups may be going with a cutesy concept, then next thing you know, the next music may show a cooler or darker theme than the previous one.

	It is also important to note the visuals of KPOP music.
	While the music itself is catchy and fun to sing along to, the choreography adds a whole new dimension to listening and viewing the music.
	This adds more personality to the music that is playing and is one of the reasons why KPOP sticks out.
	The idols put in many hours to practice their movements and lyrics to bring the masterpiece on stage for their fans, and they certainly don't disappoint!

	<dt class="kpopdrama">Some of the groups that are still performing are:</dt>
	<li class="kpopdrama">BTS
	<li class="kpopdrama">BLACKPINK
	<li class="kpopdrama">GOT7
	<li class="kpopdrama">MONSTA X
	<li class="kpopdrama">TWICE

	<h1>KDrama</h1>
	<div id="dramaimg">
	<img src="camera.jpg" height="200" width="200">
	</div>
	<p class="kpopdrama">KDrama is short for Korean drama. 
	While not as impactful as KPOP has been, still has made its mark on other countries.
	It also helps that many KPOP idols get casted to be in many different dramas.
	The OSTs from the dramas are very important to each drama and the albums from a drama plays a big part in bringing in revenue.
	Other reasons why KDrama has been able to make an impact around the world is because:
	<li class="kpopdrama">Streaming services and their availability
	<li class="kpopdrama">Organizations dedicated to support free streaming to other countries
	<li class="kpopdrama">Advertisements and partnerships with other countries
	</li>
	<p class="kpopdrama">
	KDrama is most popular among young milennial women, but it is nonetheless enjoyed by all age groups and genders all around the world.
	While romance isn't the only genre within Kdramas, it plays a big part of most dramas.	
	Much of the budget is spent on the appearances of the top stars because of the attraction they bring from fans of their previous works.
	I would say KDrama is worthy of the attention and praise it receives!
