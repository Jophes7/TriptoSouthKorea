	<p class="kpopdrama">KPOP (short for Korean pop) is a genre of music that orginated in South Korea, just as the names says.
	What makes it different from pop is the Korean traditional roots it comes from mixed in with other genres commonly found in Western society.
	The image to the left shows the girl group Red Velvet's photo decorated on a bus.
	KPOP plays a big role on the South Korean culture. 
	When marketing for the boy and girl groups, agencies come up with concepts to catch the fans' attention.
	One moment the groups may be going with a cutesy concept, then next thing you know, the next music may show a cooler or darker theme than the previous one.

	It is also important to note the visuals of KPOP music.
	While the music itself is catchy and fun to sing along to, the choreography adds a whole new dimension to listening and viewing the music.
	This adds more personality to the music that is playing and is one of the reasons why KPOP sticks out.
	The idols put in many hours to practice their movements and lyrics to bring the masterpiece on stage for their fans.
